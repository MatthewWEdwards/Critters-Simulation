 Each team should also provide a README.pdf document describing your code
structure.
o Did you create any new classes, and if so, what fields and methods are in
it?
o What is the data structure that you used to hold your Critters?

Name your critter source files Critter1.java, Critter2.java etc., and
include header comments with descriptions. Your toString() for these crit-
ters should be 1, 2 etc.
â€¢ Before submission, make sure that your main is cleaned up, so that it produces no
output to the console, and the Critter world is empty.
